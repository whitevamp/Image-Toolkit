GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                        Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, are the
publishers of this license, and we work to safeguard these freedoms for
our licensees worldwide.

The last thing we want to do is to restrict anyone from sharing or
changing this program. To the contrary, we intend for this program to be
shared and changed. We want to make it clear that this program is
freely licensed, so that you know you have the freedom to distribute
copies of it, either with or without modifications, and to use it
commercially, without ever having to ask our permission.

This license, the GNU General Public License, applies to some
software packages. We have also published other licenses, like the
Lesser General Public License, for use in more limited circumstances.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it. These responsibilities correspond to the need to protect
the freedom of the software for all its users.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
developers' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
this version of the GPL to forbid the practice for those products. If
such problems arise in other domains, we stand ready to extend this
provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting /work has been a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission from copyright, would make you liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
activating a private modification. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominent visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list would suffice.

    Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major
Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,
window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any)
on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the
work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code and
to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-
purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the
work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition
files associated with source files, and the source code for shared
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication
or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in module form need not include
the module's object code interface files.

    Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without condition so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

    Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under Article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of technological measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third party legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

    Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact
all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a
copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

    Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a modified version of the Program's source code in the
form of a newly released covered work, provided that you meet all the
conditions of this License for the covered work, and provided that your
license for the modified version includes the following license notice,
for an executable work or script:

Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

If the modified program normally interacts with a user via a terminal
interface, an interactive user interface must display "Appropriate
Legal Notices" (as defined in Section 0) when it starts running. The
notices may not be obscured. For works that do not have an interactive
user interface, such a notice will suffice if it appears in a
mechanically readable text file in a prominent location in the work.

    Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of the
ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange.

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding
Source from a network server at no charge.

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
is allowed only occasionally and non-commercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer.

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding
Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object
code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a
different server but must offer equivalent copying facilities,
provided you maintain control over the object code and the
Corresponding Source so that you can ensure the latter is always
available.

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property normally used for personal, family, or
household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modifications have been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, a
User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which
the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to
the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the
transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under
this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But
this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains
the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,
the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide network services, or to provide access
to a network server, used to distribute the Corresponding Source.

    Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as if they were included in this License, to the extent that
they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only
to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those
permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License
without regard to the additional permissions, and the latter may not
be conveyed in isolation.

"Adverse patent terms" are patent license obligations that (1)
require royalty, fee, or remuneration for exercise of rights granted
by this License, or (2) prohibit exercise of rights under this License.

"Enforced by option" means that you do not have to accept a license
if it is offered on adverse patent terms, unless that option is to be
exercised and is the only way you can convey the covered work.

"A patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however
denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to
practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).

No contributor can be given a patent license to propagate a covered
work if that contributor makes a separate agreement with a third party
to pay royalties on or otherwise limit the exercise of patent rights
in the covered work (or to sublicense such rights).

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

    Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to your
cessation of the violation.

Furthermore, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not have permission to exercise any of the rights
granted by this License.

    Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing
other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any
covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

    Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

    Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner of making,
using, or selling, of the contributor's contributor version. For purposes
of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent
sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license
from a contributor, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not
available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of
this License, through a publicly available network server or other
readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to forfeit your
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange for the
patent license to be extended to everyone in the way that it is "free
software".

A patent license is "free software" if it does not require royalty or
other payment for its exercise, and if it permits you to exercise all
rights under the GNU GPL. A patent license is "free software" if it
satisfies those criteria.

You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement
with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under
which you make payment to the third party based on the number of copies of
the covered work you convey (or use), and under which the third party
grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from
you, a patent license for the covered work, in return for payment.

If you sell, offer for sale, or promote a covered work to other parties
(including but not limited to the use of a server, a website, or a
program as a service), your grant of rights under this License (including
any patent license from contributors) is automatically extended to any
third party who sells, offers for sale, or promotes that covered work in
turn, without any royalty or other payment.

    No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If you impose additional restrictions on any recipient of the Program,
you are infringing the terms of this License. This includes any legal
device, such as a contract or a memorandum of understanding, that imposes
restrictions on users' freedom to exercise their rights under this License.

Notwithstanding this, additional permissions may be added to this
License, but in no case do they diminish or override the permissions or
requirements of this License.

    Limitations on Liability and Warranty.

THIS PROGRAM IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE USEFUL, BUT
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; WITHOUT EVEN THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

The authors, the Free Software Foundation, or any other party who
might distribute the Program, disclaim all liability for any damages
arising from your use of this Program.

If the Program is subject to U.S. export controls, you agree to comply
with those controls.

The Program is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind. You
assume all responsibility and risk for the selection of the Program to
achieve your intended results and for the installation, use, and
results obtained from the Program.

The authors, the Free Software Foundation, or any other party who
might distribute the Program, make no representations or warranties,
express or implied, about the Program or its use, including any warranty
of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular
purpose.

You acknowledge that the Program may contain errors or other problems
that could cause system failures, data loss, or other problems. You
assume all risk for any use of the Program.

The authors, the Free Software Foundation, and any other party who
might distribute the Program, are not responsible for (including without
limitation) any lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental or
consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the
Program, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

The provisions of this section 13 shall be severable.

    Interpretation of Sections 11 and 12.

If a patent license requires a royalty, or otherwise prohibits exercise
of a right granted under this License, then it cannot be granted in
conveying a covered work.

However, if such a patent license becomes necessary to exercise a right
granted under this License, and if the patent license is free, then it
can be granted in conveying a covered work.

The object of this section is to limit the effect of the patent license.
